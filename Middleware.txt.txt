// What is Middleware ?

-----> Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

---->  Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

---->  Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

. Execute any code.
. Make changes to the request and the response objects.
. End the request-response cycle.
. Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
